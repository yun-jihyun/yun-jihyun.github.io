**Revenue Management Internship at Marriott International**

# **Global Sales Organization Support Tool** 

The **Global Sales Organization (GSO)** at Marriott International manages relationships and contracts with corporate accounts. These accounts form a key part of the **corporate market segment**.  

In 2025, Marriott APEC began a major strategic shift: moving corporate contracts from **static rates** to **dynamic rates**.  

- **Static rate** → A fixed room rate, regardless of market demand. This guarantees corporates a low rate even in peak demand periods, but limits Marriott’s revenue potential.  
- **Dynamic rate** → A fixed **discount percentage** off the retail rate. This ensures corporates always get a discount, but allows room prices to rise during high-demand periods. This protects Marriott’s revenue while still offering corporates savings.  

The GSO team needed data tools to help them **negotiate with corporate clients** and convince them of the value of dynamic rates.

## 1. Problem Statement  

The challenge was to design a tool that could **clearly demonstrate to corporates:**
- How much they would save under a dynamic discount model.  
- How often those discounted rates would actually be available (given Marriott’s internal pricing rules).  

Unlike my earlier project (a loyalty dashboard focused on descriptive insights), this tool had to directly **support business strategy and negotiations.**

## 2. Logic Behind the Tool  

To solve this, I first mapped out the key pricing mechanics at play:  

1. **Forecasted Retail Average Daily Rate (ADR)** – the expected standard rate customers would pay.  
2. **Discounted ADR** – the rate after applying the chosen corporate discount.  
3. **Hurdle Revenue Constraint** – every property has a minimum revenue threshold per night (hurdle). A discounted rate is only valid if, on average over the length of stay, it meets or exceeds the hurdle.  

   *Example:*  
   - A corporate stay lasts 5 nights.  
   - The discounted ADR may fall below the hurdle on some nights.  
   - If the **average discounted ADR** across the 5 nights meets the **average hurdle**, the discount applies.  

From this, the tool needed to calculate:  
- **True Rate**: the final rate corporates would pay (discount applied where valid; retail rate applied where the discount doesn’t meet the hurdle).  
- **Availability %**: the share of check-in dates where the discount is valid.  
- **Average Unavailable Days**: how many check-in dates are excluded due to hurdle failures.

## 3. Dashboard Design (Power BI)  

The tool was built in **Power BI** with three layers of insights:  

### a) User Inputs (left panel)  
- Geography filters.  
- Input fields for **length of stay** and **discount rate**.  

### b) Core Calculations (center visuals)  
- **Forecasted Retail ADR** vs. **Discounted ADR** vs. **True Rate**.  
- **Availability %** of the discount rate.  
- **Average unavailable arrival days** across properties.  

### c) Supporting Visuals (granularity & seasonality)  
- **Trend charts** of availability % by **day of week** and **month** – useful because some corporates only travel during certain times.  
  - *Example:* If a client like BCG mainly travels in October, even if the overall yearly availability is 80%, October might show 99% availability (a persuasive point in negotiations).  
- **Property-level table** – listing unavailable check-in days and the average shortfall to the hurdle (difference between discounted ADR and hurdle). This provides the most detailed view.

## 4. Outcome  

The dashboard provides a **storytelling framework** for GSO negotiations:  
- At a **high level**, it shows seasonality and demand patterns.  
- At a **strategic level**, it quantifies the true savings corporates would achieve under dynamic rates.  
- At a **granular level**, it highlights exact dates and properties where discounts may not apply, making the discussion transparent.  

With this, the GSO team can more confidently demonstrate to corporate clients that dynamic rates are not only fair but also beneficial – striking the balance between corporate savings and Marriott’s revenue optimization.
