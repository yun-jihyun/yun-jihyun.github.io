**Revenue Management Internship at Marriott International**

# **Global Sales Organization Support Tool** 

The **Global Sales Organization (GSO)** at Marriott manages contracts with corporate accounts. These contracts are a key driver of the **special corporate market segment** in Marriott’s business. In 2025, the Marriott APEC region began a major strategic shift in this corporate segment: transitioning from **static rates** to **dynamic rates**.  

- **Static rate** → A fixed room rate, regardless of market demand.  
  - Corporates are guaranteed a low rate even during peak demand, whereas Marriott loses potential revenue by offering discounted rates during high-demand periods.
- **Dynamic rate** → A fixed **discount percentage** applied to the retail rate.
-   Rates will rise in high-demand periods, allowing Marriott to protect revenue, while still allowing corporates to receive a discounted rate. 

The purpose of this project was to build a **data-driven strategy tool** that aids the GSO team convince corporate accounts of the value of adopting **dynamic rates**.  


## **(1) Problem Statement** 

The tool needed to answer two fundamental questions for the GSO team:  
- **Corporate Savings** → How much would corporates save under a dynamic discounted rate compared to retail rates?  
- **Rate Availability** → On how many check-in days would that dynamic discounted rate actually be available?  

##### Key Challenges
- **Hurdle Revenue Constraint**:
  - Every property sets a **minimum revenue threshold per night** (hurdle). A discounted rate is only valid if, on average across the entire stay days, it exceeds this hurdle.  
- **Length of Stay Effect**:
  - Hurdle thresholds vary depending on the **length of stay (LOS)**, so the validity of a discount must be checked at the stay level, not per night.  
- **Dynamic User Inputs**:
  - The tool should allow the GSO team to enter different **discount percentages** and **lengths of stay** dynamically and see calculated results correspondingly. 


## **(2) Forecast Calculation Logic**  

The tool allows the user to input two parameters:  
1. **Length of Stay (LOS)**  
2. **Discount Percentage**  

Based on these, the tool calculates the following values:  

1. **Forecasted Retail Average Daily Rate (ADR)**  
   - The standard rate a retail segment customer would pay.  

2. **Forecasted Discounted ADR**  
   - The rate after applying the chosen corporate discount % to the retail ADR.  

3. **Forecasted Average Daily Hurdle Revenue**  
   - The minimum revenue threshold per night, averaged across the length of stay.  

4. **Forecasted True Discounted ADR**  
   - The final rate corporates would pay:  
     - If the **average discounted ADR > average hurdle**, the discounted ADR applies.  
     - If the **average discounted ADR < average hurdle**, the retail ADR applies instead.

**Example Calculation**  
Consider a **2-night stay** with a **20% discount**:  

| Check-In Date | Stay Date   | Retail ADR | Discount % | Discounted ADR | Hurdle Revenue | Avg. Discounted ADR | Avg. Hurdle Revenue |
|--------------|-------------|-----------:|-----------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------------------:|--------------------:|
| 01 Sep 2025  | 01 Sep 2025 | $300.00    | 20%        | $240.00         | $250.00        |                    |                    |
| 01 Sep 2025  | 02 Sep 2025 | $200.00    | 20%        | $160.00         | $140.00        |                    |                    |

| **Averages** |             |            |            |                 |                | **$200.00**        | **$195.00**        |

- On **01 Sep 2025**, the discounted ADR ($240) is **below** the hurdle ($250).  
- On **02 Sep 2025**, the discounted ADR ($160) is **above** the hurdle ($140).  
- However, the decision is not made per-night. Instead:  
  - Average Discounted ADR = (240 + 160) ÷ 2 = **$200.00**  
  - Average Hurdle Revenue = (250 + 140) ÷ 2 = **$195.00**
  - → Since $200 > $195, the discounted rate is valid.  
➡ The corporate will pay the **discounted ADR** for both nights.

To make the tool more practical and insightful for corporate strategy, I incorporated additional data points:
5. **Availability %**
  - The share of check-in dates where the discounted rate is available (i.e., passes the hurdle).  
6. **Average Unavailable Check-In Days**
  - The average number of check-in dates where the discounted rate cannot be applied because the rate is below the hurdle.
  - How many check-in dates are blocked due to failing the hurdle.  
7. **Average Daily Shortfall to Hurdle**
  - The average $ by which the discounted rate falls short of the hurdle.
